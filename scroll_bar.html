        <h2>MARVEL MOVIES IN ORDER: HOW TO WATCH ALL 27 MCU MOVIES</h2>
        <hr><br><hr><br>
        <p> 
        If you want to see the Marvel and Avengers movies in order as they happened, starting with the World War II-set Captain America: The First Avenger, we’ve listed all 27 MCU movies in chronological order, in one guide!
        </p><br>
        <p>
        So while Iron Man, set and released in 2008, can claim the banner as the first of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, within its story, Chris Evans has got Robert Downey Jr. beat. That’s because Evans’ origin story as Captain America in The First Avenger takes action in 1942. There, we’re also first fully introduced to the Tessarect, an energy cube that initializes the Infinity Saga, climaxing in 2019’s Avengers: Endgame.
        </p><br>
        <p>
        The next movie set in the timeline is Captain Marvel, the blockbuster with a Blockbuster, set in 1995 with Brie Larson starring as the cosmic Carol Danvers. And then it’s time to hit the start with Iron Man and RDJ’s world-making turn as Tony Stark. The movies can be seen in release order after that, except for 2021’s Black Widow, which is set in the aftermath of 2016’s Captain America: Civil War.
        </p><br>
        <p>
        After Endgame‘s epic finale (plus Spider-Man: Far From Home), Shang-Chi pushes the MCU into Phase 4. And now the the gigantic Spider-Man: No Way Home has arrived. Now’s your time to catch up or experience the MCU in a new way with all 27 Marvel movies in order. (And for more, see Marvel TV by Tomatometer, the full list of upcoming Marvel movies & series, and the 75 best superhero movies of all time.)
